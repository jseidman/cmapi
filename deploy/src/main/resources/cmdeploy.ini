# Configuration parameters for deploying a cluster via the Cloudera Manager API

[CM]
# When deploying a cluster on EC2, some calls will require the public hostname
# of the CM host, others the private hostname. See the code for more details:
cm_public_hostname=ec2-54-184-206-161.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
cm_private_hostname=ip-10-41-19-94.us-west-2.compute.internal
cm_port=7180
# CM server login credentials:
cm_user=admin
cm_password=admin

# Configuration parameters for the cluster to be deployed. 
# Although CM can deploy and manage multiple clusters, for simplicity this 
# code currently only deploys a single cluster.
[CLUSTER]
# Name for this cluster (used in the CM management UI):
cluster_name=CM API TEST
# CDH version for this cluster. See com.cloudera.api.model.ApiClusterVersion for
# valid versions.
cluster_version=CDH5
# Hostnames for datanode hosts. If using EC2, set to internal hostnames:
cluster_hosts=ip-10-43-15-78.us-west-2.compute.internal,ip-10-33-20-118.us-west-2.compute.internal,ip-10-43-21-70.us-west-2.compute.internal

# Configuration parameters for the Cloudera Manager management service. 
[MGMT_SERVICE]
# Name for management service. Displayed in the CM UI:
mgmt_service_name=MGMT
# Comma-seperated list of management roles to be deployed. 
cm_management_roletypes=HOSTMONITOR,SERVICEMONITOR,ACTIVITYMONITOR,REPORTSMANAGER,EVENTSERVER,ALERTPUBLISHER

# Configuration parameters for specific management roles. Finding the actual
# parameter names seems tricky, but the "/cm/service/roles" call seems to 
# be useful to see all of the possible values for a service - for example:
# api/v10/cm/service/roles/ACTIVITYMONITOR-1/config?view=full

# Most of the values below can be found in
#  /etc/cloudera-scm-server/db.mgmt.properties
# on the CM server host.
